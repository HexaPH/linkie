# Add Links to a Linkie

To add links to a linkie, run the command `/add` in any channel. A modal will pop up with all of the options.

## The /add Modal
#### Options:
- `linkie` - Select the Linkie to add to
- `label` - Label for the new link
- `URL` - Insert the URL for the new link

#### Possible Errors

##### 1. Already Exists
This error occurs when the label you typed in the `label` option and/or the URL you put in the `URL` option matches one of an existing link inside of that Linkie.

##### 2. Invalid URL
This error occurs when the link you typed in the `URL` option is either A: Not a valid URL (Meaning it doesn't contain https:// or http://), or B: The link you put contains too many characters (Max 200 characters).
