# Add Linkie to Discord

Obviously, before we get into any of the good stuff, we need to first [invite Linkie](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=984548791338303509&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to your Discord server.

> **NOTE:** If Linkie is offline when you add the bot to your server, the necessary configuration files will not be created and all of the commands will result in errors. To fix, just wait until Linkie is back online and then re-invite the bot.
